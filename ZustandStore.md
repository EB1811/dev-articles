# Manage your State the Modern Way – Introduction to Zustand
# Stop overcomplicating your state – Try Zustand with Immer

## Intro
With the advent of hooks a lot of React developers have started to move away from Redux as the default state management of choice. Redux seems to be an amazing tool for a bygone era, with its opinionated nature becoming a source of frustration rather than joy.
Zustand is a modern state manager that fits nicely in this world of hooks. It is lightweight (only 66.4 kB unpacked), fast, and hooks-based. QUOTE. The brilliance of Zustand is that it’s simple yet powerful.

I stumbled upon Zustand when re-designing our app’s state management. The complexity of Redux and immaturity of React Context made us want to move to another state manager. Having been burned by Redux’s aforementioned complexity, Zustand drew me in with its promised simplicity, describing itself as a ‘barebones’ state manager.
