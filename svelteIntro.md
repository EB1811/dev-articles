## Intro
Svelte was rated as the most loved web framework by developers in 2021 (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted). So what is Svelte and why is it so loved?
Svelte is a rather unique javascript framework which aims to be ‘truly reactive’ and help developers ‘write less code’.
It has the awesome feature of creating tiny code bundles by making the framework itself "disappear’ in a compilation stage, shipping optimised vanilla JavaScript code rather than using large and complex libraries loaded at run time. In my opinion, this is the game changer that makes Svelte standout from other JavaScript frameworks. A tiny bundle size means a much faster load time, which seems to be the direction the web is taking as more and more data shows the benefits of a quick website. This compilation stage also removes the need for techniques such as the virtual DOM, used by React and Vue, further increasing the speed of a website.
Another feature is the absence of boilerplate. Svelte feels very close to standard web development, where components can look exactly like vanilla HTML. I’m sure this is a big reason why developers love this framework.
